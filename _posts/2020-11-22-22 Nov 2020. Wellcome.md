I´m Julián Rodríguez, automation engineer, and Big Data expert (sports).

I´ve made several dashboards with R, such as the following about COVID-19 situation report of Spain.

Or the next one to control the training load of a soccer team.

If you want to know more details about the dashboards or if you are keen on this kind of visualizations, please contact me.
